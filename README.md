
Roman Osteology
==============

This repository contains my database of published (and some unpublished) data resulting from my research on skeletal
remains from Rome, Italy.  There are also photographs relevant to various publications, each labeled by skeleton
number (which is the ID key in the Access database).

In the database, you will find basic demographic information (age and sex), an inventory of each skeleton, skeletal
pathology data, records of teeth examined and their pathological conditions, and results of all biochemical analyses
undertaken to date (C, N, O, Sr, Pb isotopes; Pb and Sr concentration).  Note that adult measurements, subadult 
measurements, subadult dental data, and nonmetric cranial trait data will be available in the next year, once the
relevant publications come out (I'm afraid I have to embargo these raw data for the moment).  Data from my work at
Casal Bertone and Castellaccio Europarco can be found here; data from Gabii will be posted when possible. No 
information on the archaeological context of the skeletons (e.g., provenience, grave goods, etc.) is included in this database, as that information is the purview of the Archaeological Superintendency of Rome. Download the database by clicking on the "Download" button (over there on the lower right toolbar) and open with Microsoft Access.

The photographs folder currently includes shots of all individuals with scoreable porotic hyperostosis. Photographs are 
also available for many of the individuals with enamel hypoplasia, but photographs were not taken of every individual or every tooth with this enamel insult.  More photographs will be posted soon, largely related to various pathological
conditions (osteoarthritis and fractures among them).

I'm suggesting a CC BY-NC-SA license for these -- that is, feel free to use the data as you see fit for your academic publications; I just ask that you credit me appropriately. To find my own analyses and interpretations, or to get
additional context, please see the relevant publications.  If you don't have access to them, I will gladly send you a
copy of anything published or under review.  I'm also more than happy to collaborate on projects involving these data.
